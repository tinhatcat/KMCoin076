If this is your first time running KMCoin please read.


To be minted on the ledger and player_info page a
new player must run KMCoin while mining any block.
This block and the private key created by the player's
password may never be changed once this block is mined.
To check if a player has been added to the player_info
page, see 'Sync with Chain' below. Once a player is added
to the this page, they never have to run KMCoin again to
receive block rewards.


Mining Only

Use Player Name as seen in the Minecraft server.
Leave Minecraft open as full screen or windowed.
This mode will not output any block information.
It will write the player's hash to ledger_current
and update their balance to players running KMCoin.


Sync with Chain

To sync with chain do command !sync in the kmcbot-chat
located in the discord channel at discord.gg/thekittymine
Download the files and click 'Ready'.
